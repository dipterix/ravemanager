## Roadmap

* What is "Frequency"
* Scientific meaning of "Frequency" in neuroscience
* How to extract frequency information

## What is "Frequency"

> Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. Frequency is expressed in units of hertz (Hz) which is equivalent to one (event) per second.

### Examples

* I drive 2 cups of coffee every day ($2.32\times 10^{-5}$ Hz)
* A clock rings once every hour ($2.78\times 10^{-4}$ Hz)
* My heart beats around once per second (1 Hz)

* Human can hear sound as low as 20 Hz
* One second of a video clip contains 24 static pictures (24 Hz)
* My screen refreshes every 0.017 seconds (60 Hz, so does your AC electric power)
* My car engine can reach up to 6000 RPM (rounds per minute) (100 Hz)
* A drum can emit sound at 200 Hz, similar range to bass, but a guitar can easily reach to 600 Hz
* The highest note Mariah Carey ever reached is Bb7 at the MTV 1991 VMAs (3.7 kHz ?!)
* Human can hear up to sound oscillating at 20 kHz

* Maximum frequency range of AM radio is 1605 kHz
* Philly WRTI radio station is operating at 90.1 MHz
* Some wifi signals are 2.4 GHz (so are the microwave ovens)
* JWST telescope can detect light as low as ~ 1THz
* Human can see lights ~ 400 THz (red) - 800 THz (purple)

## Why frequency matters?

### Amount of information being carried

> "A neuron sending a signal (i.e., a presynaptic neuron) releases a chemical called a neurotransmitter, which binds to a receptor on the surface of the receiving (i.e., postsynaptic) neuron."
> <small>The principles of nerve cell communication. Alcohol Health Res World. 1997;21(2):107-8. PMID: 15704344; PMCID: PMC6826821.</small>

A whole period includes a close loop of releasing, receiving, and returning neurotransmitter (one **cycle**)

### Amount of energy & travel distance

Check this [video](https://vimeo.com/300888983) and this [article](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/resources/2681-waves-and-energy-energy-transfer)

1. The stronger a signal is (amplitude), the further it can travels
2. The energy of a wave is positively correlated to amplitude & frequency

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="300px"}
x <- seq(0,1, by = 0.01)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(x, sin(10 * pi * x), type = "l", xlab = "Time (s)",
     ylab = "", ylim = c(-2,2))
plot(x, 1.5 * sin(10 * pi * x), type = "l", 
     xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = "", ylim = c(-2,2))
plot(x, sin(20 * pi * x), type = "l", 
     xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = "", ylim = c(-2,2))
```

* → If the total amount of energy is fixed, signal travel distance is smaller when frequency becomes higher
* → If the travel distance is fixed (same amplitude), signals with lower frequency consume less energy (also less information)

## Extract frequency components

Before discussing the frequency decomposition, let take look at simple sine & cosine waves. 

### Simple sine/cosine waves

$$\sin(2\pi ft), \cos(2\pi ft)$$

```{r, out.height="400px"}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(time, sin(2*pi*time), type = "l", main = "1Hz sine wave")
grid()
plot(time, cos(2*pi*time), type = "l", main = "1Hz cosine wave")
grid()

plot(time, sin(10* 2*pi*time), type = "l", main = "10Hz sine wave")
grid()
plot(time, cos(10* 2*pi*time), type = "l", main = "10Hz cosine wave")
grid()
```

Why using `sin` & `cos` functions?

* Easy to derive frequency (which is $f$)
* Excellent mathematical properties

Other types of basis:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height="250px"}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
y <- sin(2*pi*time)
plot(time, (as.numeric(y > 0) - 0.5) * sqrt(2) * 2, type = "l", main = "1Hz step function basis")
grid()
y <- cos(2*pi*time)
plot(time, (as.numeric(y > 0) - 0.5) * sqrt(2) * 2, type = "l", main = "1Hz step function basis")
grid()
```


### Frequency decomposition

Our goal is to decompose a complicated stationary signal into linear combinations of simple single-frequency components:

$$s(t) = a_{0} + a_{1} \cos(2\pi f_1 t) + b_{1} \sin(2\pi f_1 t) + \\
      + a_{2} \cos(2\pi f_2 t) + b_{2} \sin(2\pi f_2 t) + ...$$
      
* For each frequency $f$, there is a pair of `sin` and `cos` waves!

#### An example

A real signal often contains multiple frequency sources. Frequency decomposition decomposes signals into components oscillating at different frequencies.

The following signal is a summation of three components: 0Hz, 12Hz sine wave, and 25 Hz cosine wave:

$$s(t) = 1 + 0.6 \sin(2\pi \times 12 t) + 0.4 \cos(2\pi \times 25 t)$$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
layout(matrix(c(1,1,1,2,3,4), 2, byrow = TRUE))
signal <- 1 + 0.6 * sin(24 * pi * time) + 0.4 * cos(50 * pi * time)

plot(time, signal, type = "l", main = "Signal", xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = bquote("Voltage ("~mu~"V)"), ylim = c(-2, 2))

plot(time, time * 0 + 1, type = 'l', xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = bquote("Voltage ("~mu~"V)"), main = "Component 1", ylim = c(-2, 2))

plot(time, 0.6 * sin(24 * pi * time), type = 'l', xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = bquote("Voltage ("~mu~"V)"), main = "Component 2", ylim = c(-2, 2))

plot(time, 0.4 * cos(50 * pi * time), type = 'l', xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = bquote("Voltage ("~mu~"V)"), main = "Component 3", ylim = c(-2, 2))
```

$$a_{0} = 1\\ a_{1} = 0, b_{1} = 0.6\\ a{2} = 0.4, b_{2} = 0$$

* We call number before each frequency component "**coefficient**" for that frequency. In this special case, the coefficient for 0Hz is 1, for 12Hz sine wave is 0.6, for 25Hz cosine wave is 0.4. 

* We use a complex number to represent the coefficient:
  * For 0Hz, $a_{0}=1$, we have coefficient $1+0i$
  * For 12Hz, $a_{12}=0, b_{12}=0.6$, we have coefficient $0+0.6i$
  * For 25Hz, $a_{25}=0.4, b_{25}=0$, we have coefficient $0.4+0i$

  - <details><summary style="display: inline">Why complex number? (click me to see the answer)</summary> Real for cosine components, imaginary for sine components, then $a \cos(2\pi ft)+b \sin(2\pi ft) = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \cos(2\pi ft + \phi)$ ($\phi$ is called phase, but we are not interested in it for now). Remember how to calculate length of a complex number? ($\|a+bi\|=\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$)</details>

* The length of a complex coefficient is called "**amplitude**"

### Frequency-domain: spectrum

For simple sine, cosine waves, **as long as the frequency is given**, the signal data can be easily plotted, hence we are no longer interested in the time series plot of sine/cosine waves. 

Instead plotting each individual sine/cosine waves, we are interested in 

1. Frequency of the `sin` & `cos` waves
2. The coefficients of the `sin` & `cos` waves


```{r}
freq <- c(0, 12, 25)
amp <- c(1, 0.6, 0.4)
plot(freq, amp, type = "n", xlab = "Frequency (Hz)", ylab = "Amplitude", main = "Frequency Domain", ylim = c(0, 1), xlim = c(0, 50), axes = FALSE)
grid()
points(freq, amp, type = "h")
axis(1, c(freq, 1000))
axis(2, c(0, 0.5, 1), las = 1)
```

## Fourier transform (Showcases)

Fourier transform is a tool to decompose a stationary signal into combinations of single sine & cosine waves.

### Showcase 1

$$s(t) = \sin(12 * 2\pi ft)$$

```{r fft-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# library(ravetools)
# srate <- 2000; time <- seq(0, 1, 1/srate)
signal <- sin(12 * 2 *pi * time)

spec_plot(signal, flim = 20)
```

### Showcase 2

$$s(t) = 1 + 0.6 \sin(12\times 2\pi t) + 0.4 \cos(25\times 2\pi t)$$

```{r fft-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
# library(ravetools)
# srate <- 2000; time <- seq(0, 1, 1/srate)
signal <- 1 + 0.6 * sin(24 * pi * time) + 0.4 * cos(50 * pi * time)

spec_plot(signal, flim = 50)
```

### Showcase 3

$$s(t) = (1 + \sin(12\omega t)) * \cos(\sin(50\omega t) - t)\text{ , where }\omega=2\pi$$

```{r fft-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
signal <- (1 + sin(24 * pi * time)) * cos(sin(100 * pi * time)-time)

spec_plot(signal, flim = 300)
```

### Showcase 4 - White noise

Normal distributed noise

```{r fft-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
signal <- rnorm(length(time))

spec_plot(signal, flim = 50)
```

### Showcase 5 - Random walk

```{r fft-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
signal <- cumsum(rnorm(length(time)))

spec_plot(signal, flim = 50)
```


### Showcase 6 - `1/f` noise

```{r fft-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
n <- length(time)
n_half <- floor(n+1) / 2
pd <- (exp((1:n_half) / 60) + 0.4) * exp(2i*pi*runif(n_half))
pd <- c(rev(pd), pd[-1])
signal <- Re(fft(pd, inverse = TRUE))
signal <- signal / sum(signal)

spec_plot(signal, flim = 300)
```

### Showcase 7 - Amplitude modulation

```{r fft-7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
wrapper <- splinefun(seq(0, 1, 0.1), sample(11))
signal <- wrapper(x = time) * sin(100 * pi * time)
spec_plot(signal, flim = 80)
```

### Showcase 8 - Frequency modulation

```{r fft-8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
base_freq <- 30
freq_mod_function <- splinefun(seq(0, 1, 0.1), sample(80, 11))
freq_mod <- cumsum(freq_mod_function(time)) / srate
signal <- sin(2 * pi * (base_freq * time + freq_mod))
spec_plot(signal, flim = 200)
```

## Fourier transform (Dot-product)

### Dot-product

* $a = [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4]$
* $b = [b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4]$

Dot-product is denoted as $a \cdot b$, or $ab$, with 
$$a\cdot b = a_1b_1 +a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 + a_4b_4$$

Dot-product can represent the "similarity" between $a$ and $b$ (given fixed lengths $\|a\|$ and $\|b\|$).

For example, let's fix the lengths such that $\|a\|=\|b\|=1$, let 

$$a=[0.6, 0.8]$$

Can you find $b$ that maximize $ab$, while $\|b\| = 1$? 

* $a$ project onto $b$, then multiply ([visual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#/media/File:Dot_Product.svg))
* What if $b$ is orthogonal to $a$? (say $b=[-0.8, 0.6]$)

```{r question-1, echo=FALSE}
question("Select one or more from the followings that have non-zero dot-product with $\\sin(12 \\times 2\\pi t)$, where $t = [0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 1]$:",
         type = "multiple",
  answer("$\\sin(12 \\times 2\\pi t)$", correct = TRUE),
  answer("$\\cos(12 \\times 2\\pi t)$"),
  answer("$\\sin(13 \\times 2\\pi t)$"),
  answer("$\\sin(24 \\times 2\\pi t)$"),
  answer("$\\sin(6 \\times 2\\pi t)$"),
  answer("$\\cos(6 \\times 2\\pi t)$")
)
```

```{r question-1-ex, exercise = TRUE}
a <- sin(12 * 2*pi*time)
b_choices <- c(
  "sin(12 * 2*pi*time)",
  "cos(12 * 2*pi*time)",
  "sin(13 * 2*pi*time)",
  "sin(24 * 2*pi*time)",
  "sin(6 * 2*pi*time)",
  "cos(6 * 2*pi*time)"
)

for(b_str in b_choices) {
  b <- eval(parse(text = b_str))
  message(sprintf("b = %s, ab = %.4f", b_str, sum(a * b)))
}
```


```{r fft_dotprod, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fft_dotprod <- function(freq, signal, srate) {
  time <- seq(0, length(signal) - 1) / srate
  kernel_cos <- cos(freq * 2 * pi * time)
  kernel_sin <- sin(freq * 2 * pi * time)
  
  coef_cos <- sum(signal * kernel_cos)
  coef_sin <- sum(signal * kernel_sin)
  
  return(coef_cos + coef_sin * 1i)
}
```

```{r fft_dotprod-ex, exercise = TRUE}
signal <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
fft_dotprod(freq = 12, signal, srate)
```


## Fourier transform (Frequency)

> How to choose frequency?

* `fft_dotprod`: In theory, any frequency should work if sample rate is infinite, and signal lasts forever ($t\rightarrow \infty$)
* However, real data is discrete, time is limited

```{r choose-frequency-ex, exercise = TRUE}
signal <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
fft_dotprod(freq = 12, signal, srate)

# Should be 0 in theory
fft_dotprod(freq = srate - 12, signal, srate)

# Should be 0 in theory
fft_dotprod(freq = 14.1, signal, srate)
```


### Examples

```{r freq-ex-1, exercise = TRUE}
signal_a <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
signal_b <- sin(2 * pi * 24 * time)
# signal_b <- sin(2 * pi * 14.1 * time)
# signal_b <- sin(2 * pi * 1988 * time)

plot(time, signal_a, type = "l", xlim = c(0, 0.25), xaxs = "i")
points(time, signal_b, type = "l", col = 'red')
# abline(v = 1 / 12 * (1:12), col = 'blue', lty = 2)
# abline(v = 1 / 24 * (1:24), col = 'gray', lty = 3)

# fft_dotprod(freq = 24, signal_a, srate)
```


```{r freq-ex-2, exercise = TRUE}
signal_a <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
signal_b <- sin(2 * pi * 1988 * time)

time2 <- seq(0, 1, by = 1e-4)
signal_a2 <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time2)
signal_b2 <- sin(2 * pi * 1988 * time2)

plot(time, signal_a, type = "o", xlim = c(0, 0.03), xaxs = "i", pch = 20)
points(time, signal_b, type = "o", col = 'red', pch = 20)
points(time2, signal_a2, type = "l")
points(time2, signal_b2, type = "l", col = "red")
abline(v = 1 / 12 * (1:12), col = 'gray', lty = 2)
```

Frequency selection:

* To make sure "cycle" number is integers, frequency is selected from `seq(0, srate, length.out = n)`, where `n` is the total time points
* To avoid aliasing effect, the amplitude is valid when frequency is $\leq$ `srate / 2` (this is called [`Nyquist frequency`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency))


## Fourier transform (Implement)

In `R`, we use `fft` (fast-Fourier transform) to obtain the Fourier coefficients. However, 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
signal <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
n <- length(signal)
coef <- fft(signal)
amplitude <- abs(coef)
freq <- seq(0, srate, length.out = n)
plot(freq, amplitude, type = "h", main = "Frequency Domain")
```

The amplitude needs to be normalized:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
signal <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
n <- length(signal)
# Normalize!
coef <- fft(signal) / n
amplitude <- abs(coef)
freq <- seq(0, srate, length.out = n)
plot(freq, amplitude, type = "h", main = "Frequency Domain")
```

Nyquist frequency is `r srate/2` Hz, we fold amplitude greater than Nyquist back

```{r, fft-impl, exercise=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
signal <- sin(2 * pi * 12 * time)
n <- length(signal)

# Normalize!
coef <- fft(signal) / n
amplitude <- abs(coef)

# Nyquist
freq <- seq(0, srate, length.out = n)
nq <- srate / 2

is_alias <- freq > nq
valid_frequency <- freq[ !is_alias ]
valid_amplitude <- amplitude[ !is_alias ]
alias_amplitude <- amplitude[ is_alias ]

# fold alias amplitude back
fold_index <- seq(length(valid_amplitude), by = -1, length.out = sum(is_alias))
valid_amplitude[fold_index] <- valid_amplitude[fold_index] + alias_amplitude

plot(valid_frequency, valid_amplitude, type = "h", 
     main = "Frequency Domain", xlim = c(0,25))
```
