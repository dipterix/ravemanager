## Introduction

This series of discussions aims at sharing the knowledge on how to use R & RAVE to perform iEEG studies at Beauchamp's lab. The goal is by the end of the sessions, you can

* Understand the basic knowledge about what iEEG study does and doesn't
* Explain what preprocessing steps we do (high-level ideas and low-level implementations)
  - signal processing
  - imaging data
* Learn the basics of programming in R to perform valid statistical analyses and generate publication-ready figures

This tutorial is NOT designed 

* for those who want to master their programming skills
* to deliver how to use famous/fancy libraries

To run this tutorial, use the following command

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ravemanager::run_tutorials()
```

The discussion list will grow as the discussion sessions continue. Please stay tuned for updates using R command `ravemanager::version_info()`, and update to the latest tutorials using:

```{r install-ravemanager, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
lib_path <- Sys.getenv(
  "RAVE_LIB_PATH", unset = Sys.getenv(
    "R_LIBS_USER", unset = .libPaths()[[1]]
  ))
install.packages(
  "ravemanager", lib = lib_path,
  repos = "https://beauchamplab.r-universe.dev"
)
```

Have a good trip :)

## What's iEEG

```{r example-signal-of-ieeg, results='hide', out.width="100%", message=FALSE}
repository <- raveio::prepare_subject_raw_voltage_with_epoch(
  subject = "demo/DemoSubject",
  electrodes = c(13:16,24),
  epoch_name = "auditory_onset",
  time_windows = c(-1, 2),
  quiet = TRUE
)
raveio::voltage_baseline(repository, c(-1, -0.5), method = "subtract_mean")

# This plot is not real

    repository$raw_voltage$baselined[, 4, 1:5]
  )),

## Why and why not iEEG

### Advantages

Compared to fMRI, DTI:

* Direct measure of electrical brain activity
* High temporal resolution and precision (match the speed of cognition)

Compared to EEG:

* **Higher signal to noise ratio (especially at >80Hz)**
* Higher spatial precision & smaller-scale potentials
* In-depth recording signals from deep-brain
* Allowing brain stimulation

### Disadvantages

* Invasive
* Limited spatial density
* High temporal resolution and precision
  - statistical analyses & data visualizations are time-consuming 
  - hard for analyzing slower cognitive process

## Terminology

* **Electrode**: are the physical sensors which form the "point of contact" between the acquisition system and the brain (Holdgraf et al, 2019). 
* **Channels**: are the digital signals recorded by the amplifiers. It is important to distinguish them from the sensors. Channels consist of two electrodes whose activity is referenced to another more distant electrode to form the signal (referential montages).
* **iEEG Signals**: are voltages at given sites at series of given time-point. 

More [terminologies here](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/research/projects/human-time-data/documents/data-lifecycle/ieeg/resources/ieeg-doc-firstdraft.pdf)

The key is always remember that voltage is the electric potential between two locations (electrodes). [It's relative!](https://youtu.be/-A9jK7mKZbs)

## What is special about Broadband high frequency activities (BHA)?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipterix/ravemanager/main/inst/tutorials/2022-11-03-sess01-Introduction/images/Ray2.png" width="150px"/>

Background: [Studies on brain waves reveal oscillatory activity in blocks frequency bands ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation)

### Paper reading:

https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000610#s1

Two hypotheses on BHA:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipterix/ravemanager/main/inst/tutorials/2022-11-03-sess01-Introduction/images/Ray1.png" width="100%"/>

> <small>Tips: Couple of years ago, we call signals higher than 80 Hz "high-gamma". It seems that we don't use that name nowadays. Instead, we tend to call it "Broadband high-frequency". The paper was published in 2011, hence it still used the term "high-gamma". </small>

Questions: 

* Why V1 (primary visual cortex)?
* What are the pre-existing conditions/observations used to help with the proof?
* How the data are presented?

## What's next

In the coming sessions, we want to go through the details of signal processing steps and statistical analyses used in this paper.

The code will be presented in `R`, with both high level library functions and low level implementations.

## Introduction to R

### Install R & RStudio

> If you haven't installed R & RStudio, please following the following videos to install them

* Install R:
  - Instruction video: https://vimeo.com/203516510
  - Official website: https://cran.r-project.org/

* Install RStudio:
  - Instruction video: https://vimeo.com/203516968
  - Official website: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

### Cheetsheet

[Check Base-R Cheatsheet Here!](https://posit.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/base-r.pdf)

## Basic syntax

Commenting, assigning variables, printing

```{r basic-R-syntax-1, exercise=TRUE}

# 1. Use `#` to start commenting 

# 2. Load a library
library(raveio)

# 3. Use `<-` (`option` + `-`) to assign variables
x <- 1

# 4. Print an object with `print`
print("Hello")
```

Other ways to inspect an object is via functions `typeof(x)`, `class(x)`, `str(x)`, and `mode(x)`


### How to get help?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
?ravetools::pwelch
```

Try it here:

```{r use-helps, exercise=TRUE}

# Uncomment the following line and run
# ?ravetools::pwelch

```

### Vectors, matrices, arrays

Create vectors

```{r examples-vectors, exercise=TRUE}

c(1, 2, 3.4)

1:10

seq(1, 10, by = 3)

rep(1, 10)

rep(1:3, times = 3)

rep(1:3, each = 3)

```

Create matrices

```{r examples-matrices, exercise = TRUE}
matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)

x <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
print(x)

dim(x)
```

Append columns/rows to a matrix

```{r examples-matrix-bind, exercise=TRUE}
x <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

cbind(x, c(5, 6))

rbind(x, c(5, 6))
```


Create arrays

```{r examples-arrays, exercise = TRUE}
array(1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))
```

### Subset data

```{r examples-subset, exercise = TRUE}
x1 <- 1:10
x1[1:5]

x1[-(1:5)]

x <- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4)
x[,1]

x[,1, drop = FALSE]

x[1:2, ]
```

## An iEEG example

Let's load raw voltage signals from our demo subject. Our goal is to load the ERP (trial-epoched) data from electrode channel `14` and visualize the first 20 trials:

To do so, we need to load one of the RAVE package `raveio` and `ravetools`

```{r ieeg-load, echo = TRUE}
library(ravetools)
library(raveio)

## If you are not sure about which epoch to use
# subject <- as_rave_subject("demo/DemoSubject")
# print(subject$epoch_names)

repository <- prepare_subject_raw_voltage_with_epoch(
  subject = "demo/DemoSubject",
  electrodes = 14,
  epoch_name = "auditory_onset", 
  time_windows = c(-1, 2)
)
print(repository)

repository <- voltage_baseline(
  x = repository, 
  baseline_windows = c(-1, 0), 
  method = "subtract_mean"
)

baselined_data <- repository$raw_voltage$baselined
print(baselined_data)
```

`baselined_data` is a special type of array, you can slice it like other normal arrays. 

Next, we want to get the first 20 trials and visualize them

```{r ieeg-load-subset-exercise, echo=TRUE}
# Load 10 trials from the first and only one electrode
slice <- baselined_data[, 1:10, 1]

# Graphics parameters, will learn in the future
par(mar = c(3.1, 2.1, 2.1, 0.8) * (0.25 + 1 * 0.75),
    mgp = c(2, 0.5, 0))

# Plot the signals in paralell flavor
plot_signals(
  signals = t(slice), 
  sample_rate = 2000,
  main = "First 10 trials from electrode channel 14", 
  ylab = "Trial", 
  time_shift = -1
)

# Add a vertical line
abline(v = 0, lty = 2, col = "red")
```


Try it by yourself!

```{r ieeg-load-exercise-try, exercise=TRUE}
library(ravetools)
library(raveio)

## If you are not sure about which epoch to use
# subject <- as_rave_subject("demo/DemoSubject")
# print(subject$epoch_names)

repository <- prepare_subject_raw_voltage_with_epoch(
  subject = "demo/DemoSubject",
  electrodes = 14,
  epoch_name = "auditory_onset", 
  time_windows = c(-1, 2)
)

repository <- voltage_baseline(
  x = repository, 
  baseline_windows = c(-1, 0), 
  method = "subtract_mean"
)

baselined_data <- repository$raw_voltage$baselined

# Load 10 trials from the first and only one electrode
slice <- baselined_data[, 1:10, 1]

# Graphics parameters, will learn in the future
par(mar = c(3.1, 2.1, 2.1, 0.8) * (0.25 + 1 * 0.75),
    mgp = c(2, 0.5, 0))

# Plot the signals in paralell flavor
plot_signals(
  signals = t(slice), 
  sample_rate = 2000,
  main = "First 10 trials from electrode channel 14", 
  ylab = "Trial", 
  time_shift = -1
)

# Add a vertical line
abline(v = 0, lty = 2, col = "red")
```
